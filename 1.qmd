# Profile

Hello! I'm a graduate of George Mason
University with a Master's Certificate in Business Analytics and a
Bachelor's degree in History, with minors in Business and Judaic
Studies. I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Data Engineering with a
concentration in Business Analytics.\
\
My previous roles have
sharpened my problem-solving and customer service skills, and I'm eager
to grow in new environments that challenge me and expand my perspective.
Additionally, I bring my experience in data handling and processing
tools such as SAS JMP, Qualtrics, Altair Studio, and Tableau. I have
worked on churn detection projects across multiple industries, conducted
loan default analysis, and led professional research and survey
initiatives.

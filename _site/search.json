I’m a graduate of George Mason University with a Master’s Certificate in Business Analytics and a Bachelor’s degree in History, with minors in Business and Judaic Studies. I’m currently pursuing an M.S. in Data Engineering with a concentration in Business Analytics.\n\nMy previous roles have sharpened my problem-solving and customer service skills, and I’m eager to grow in new environments that challenge me and expand my perspective. Additionally, I bring my experience in data handling and processing tools such as SAS JMP, Qualtrics, Altair Studio, and Tableau. I have worked on churn detection projects across multiple industries, conducted loan default analysis, and led professional research and survey initiatives.\nLinkedIn"

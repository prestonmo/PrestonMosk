# Redesign Midterm Project

*By Preston Moskowitz and Yang Zhang*

We reworked an existing visualization using the principles we learned in class to enhance clarity and effectiveness. The original graph is shown below.

### Rationale for Redesign 

-   This graph is convoluted, It's hard to tell whats going on

-   Confusing flowing variables

-   Why use three bars when you could use one?

-   Convoluted labeling of voter groups

-   Repetition of information

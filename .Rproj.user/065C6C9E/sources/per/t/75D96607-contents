# Redesign Midterm Project

*By Preston Moskowitz and Yang Zhang*

This page redesigns a Sankey-style flow from Pew Research about how **2020 voters and nonvoters behaved in 2024**.\
The original is engaging but hard for **precise comparison**: long eye travel and overlapping ribbons make it difficult to judge **retention**, **switching**, and **drop-off**. We applied principles learned in class to enhance this visualizations clarity and effectiveness.

> **Data note:** No raw download was provided. In line with the assignment guideline (“Exact data is not required”), I **reconstructed a small table** from the published figure with clearly labeled percentages.

## Data & Setup

Between 2020 and 2024, most voters remained consistent in their choices,\
but about one-quarter changed their behavior. Trump’s supporters were\
more likely than Biden’s to turn out again in 2024, and a greater share\
of 2020 nonvoters who participated in 2024 backed Trump. These shifts in\
turnout and vote choice played a key role in Trump’s victory.

Here is the original visualization we are redesigning:

### Rationale for Redesign

-   This graph is complicated, It's hard to tell whats going on

-   Confusing flowing variables

-   Why use three bars when you could use one?

-   Convoluted labeling of voter groups

-   Repetition of information

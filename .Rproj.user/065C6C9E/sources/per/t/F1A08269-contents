## Overall Findings

Compared with the Sankey, **between-cohort contrasts** become immediate.\
The stacked view emphasizes **within-cohort composition**; the grouped view emphasizes **mechanisms** (retention/switch/drop-off).\
Together, they clarify whether turnout change or switching played the larger role.

Meanwhile, the election result visualizations highlight concrete outcomes and enable direct year-over-year comparisons. By using clear, scaled visuals, everyone can easily interpret vote share, quantify changes between election cycles, and assess how party support has evolved over time. We believe we have found a more effective way to communicate this data to a broader audience by following the principles of data visualization.

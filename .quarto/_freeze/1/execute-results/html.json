We applied principles learned in class to enhance this visualizations clarity and effectiveness.\n\n> **Data note:** No raw download was provided. In line with the assignment guideline (“Exact data is not required”), I **reconstructed a small table** from the published figure with clearly labeled percentages.\n\n## Data & Setup\n\nBetween 2020 and 2024, most voters remained consistent in their choices,\\\nbut about one-quarter changed their behavior. Trump’s supporters were\\\nmore likely than Biden’s to turn out again in 2024, and a greater share\\\nof 2020 nonvoters who participated in 2024 backed Trump. These shifts in\\\nturnout and vote choice played a key role in Trump’s victory.\n\nHere is the original visualization we are redesigning:\n\n![Original Visualization From Pew](images/original.jpg)\n\n### Rationale for Redesign\n\n-   This graph is complicated, It's hard to tell whats going on\n\n-   Confusing flowing variables\n\n-   Why use three bars when you could use one?\n\n-   Convoluted labeling of voter groups\n\n-   Repetition of information\n## Video Presentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{{< embed url=\"https://youtu.be/iNTL3yPQV1o\" >}}\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## References\n\nPew Research Center.
